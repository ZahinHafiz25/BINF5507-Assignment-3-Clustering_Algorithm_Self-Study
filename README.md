BINF5507 Assignment 3 - Clustering Algorithm (Self-Study): 
This assignment involves the understanding of the clustering algorithm, DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), and its comparison to other clustering algorithms such as KMeans and Agglomerative/Heirarchical Clustering. 
Note: All answers have been submitted on Blackboard (as a PDF file). 
Part 1: An overview of the DBSCAN algorithm, its key parameters, and strengths & limitations. 
Part 2 (Visualizations): Codes for algorithm comparison have been uploaded on GitHub (Assignment_3_main.ipnyb). 
Part 2 (Analysis): Explains the performance, failure cases, and trade-offs of the clustering algorithms. 
Part 3: A comprehensive table which compares and contrasts the characteristics of DBSCAN, KMeans, and Agglomerative/Heirarchical Clustering.
